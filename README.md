## How to ruby

#### This is how to define a **variable**:

```
$ x = 10
$ x = "string"
$ x = ["this", "is", "an", "array"]
```

A variable can be used to store a value. This value can be a number, series of letters- a **string**- or it can be an array, which is a series of values.

#### These are **conditions**:
1. "=="
2. "!="
3. ">"
4. "<"
5. ">="
6. "<="
7. "||"
8. "^"
```
if (condition)
    x = 3
end

while (condition)
    x = x - 1
end
```

Conditions are used to determine

```
def my_method(a)
  a + 10
end
```
